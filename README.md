### Introduction

This is a starter template to work with NodeJS (typescript) and Angular 6. It shares models between Angular
and NodeJS. Both of the NodeJS and and Angular 6 can run on the same webserver as the NodeJS exposes all of the
default routes to Angular and all of the known routes to the api.
